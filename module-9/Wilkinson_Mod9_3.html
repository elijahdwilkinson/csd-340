<p>I never really knew what I wanted to be growing up. A <span id = "rock-star">_______________</span>? A famous F1 racer? The family disappointment? It seemed like I could be anything. In middle school and high school I was never really presented with any options. We were discouraged from looking at aspirations outside what
    our general education included so it was difficult to really get any meaningful insight  to a professional world outside of math, life science, English and history.
</p>

<p>Well, once <span id = "college">_______________</span> rolled around I, like many 18-ish year olds, had only a cursory understanding of what I wanted to. Some ideas, some potential career paths, but growing up in a town of 3,000 people, it wasn't exactly easy to get much experience or introduction to much.
    I first decided I'd try my hand at art, which turned out to be a waste of time; not because art itself is a waste of time, but because I'm <span id = "hopeless">_______________</span> as an artist. I bounced around a couple of majors, but eventually landed on Media Arts & Communication.
</p>

<p>This wasn't as bad of a major as I thought; I actually really enjoyed my classes, and was even able to get an internship which I also enjoyed. Overall, I had a lot of fun here, and when I transferred to a bigger school in a bigger city I realized... Well I realized it's also not what I 
    wanted to do. At this point, however, it was a little too late to be indecisive. I graduated and found jobs here and there in graphic design or marketing. Eventually, I did find a good job in marketing and my employer supported my next educational goal: a bachelor's in <span id = "software-development">_______________</span>.

<p class="intro">My father was the town's local strongman and my mother was a werewolf. My brothers and sisters were various were-creatures and a sentient tree named Carthunax. It was hard to make friends given my family circumstances, but I became
    good friends with the foreign exchange student from Ireland named Siobhan. </p>

<p>My hometown was Falconer, NY, a beautiful town with memorable landmarks such as the local Walmart, and way too many McDonalds and Tim Hortons. My hobbies during my childhood were limited by my geography, so I got really into hackey-sack and pretending I had any business playing basketball.
    I attended the local high-school where I learned everything I need to know about mitochondria and the world's most disappointing lunches. </p>

<p>After finishing up high school, I attended the local community college which genuinely was the best experience in education I've ever had. I made a lot of friends that had similar hobbies to my own which previously wasn't possible as I was absolutely "othered" by my colleagues in high school.
    After graduating, I moved to Buffalo, NY another city with too many Tim Hortons only now with extra fatal blizzards.</p>

    
<p> <span class="sentence">Living in Buffalo is when I truly came into my own as an individual. </span> I discovered new hobbies like making music boxes, digital art, motorcycles, and music. Additionally, I made even more friends, many of which I'm still very close with. Buffalo is still where I find myself,
    however, as time moves on I find myself itching to relocate, but to where I have no idea. Find out in chapter 2 of this riveting tale. </p>
