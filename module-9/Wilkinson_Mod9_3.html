<h1> Assignment 9.3: JavaScript - Part 1 </h1>


<p>I never really knew what I wanted to be growing up. A <span id = "rock-star">_______________</span>? A famous F1 racer? The family disappointment? It seemed like I could be anything. In middle school and high school I was never really presented with any options. We were discouraged from looking at aspirations outside what
    our general education included so it was difficult to really get any meaningful insight  to a professional world outside of math, life science, English and history.
</p>

<p>Well, once <span id = "college">_______________</span> rolled around I, like many 18-ish year olds, had only a cursory understanding of what I wanted to. Some ideas, some potential career paths, but growing up in a town of 3,000 people, it wasn't exactly easy to get much experience or introduction to much.
    I first decided I'd try my hand at art, which turned out to be a waste of time; not because art itself is a waste of time, but because I'm <span id = "hopeless">_______________</span> as an artist. I bounced around a couple of majors, but eventually landed on Media Arts & Communication.
</p>

<p>This wasn't as bad of a major as I thought; I actually really enjoyed my classes, and was even able to get an internship which I also enjoyed. Overall, I had a lot of fun here, and when I transferred to a bigger school in a bigger city I realized... Well I realized it's also not what I 
    wanted to do. At this point, however, it was a little too late to be indecisive. I graduated and found jobs here and there in graphic design or marketing. Eventually, I did find a good job in marketing and my employer supported my next educational goal: a bachelor's in <span id = "software-development">_______________</span>.
