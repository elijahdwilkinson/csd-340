<h1>The Book of Eli "No, Not the One You're Thinking of." </h1>

<h2>Chapter 1: Humble Beginnings </h2>

<!-- Applies intro class to the first paragraph.-->
<p class="intro">My father was the town's local strongman and my mother was a werewolf. My brothers and sisters were various were-creatures and a sentient tree named Carthunax. It was hard to make friends given my family circumstances, but I became
    good friends with the foreign exchange student from Ireland named Siobhan. </p>

<p>My hometown was Falconer, NY, a beautiful town with memorable landmarks such as the local Walmart, and way too many McDonalds and Tim Hortons. My hobbies during my childhood were limited by my geography, so I got really into hackey-sack and pretending I had any business playing basketball.
    I attended the local high-school where I learned everything I need to know about mitochondria and the world's most disappointing lunches. </p>

<p>After finishing up high school, I attended the local community college which genuinely was the best experience in education I've ever had. I made a lot of friends that had similar hobbies to my own which previously wasn't possible as I was absolutely "othered" by my colleagues in high school.
    After graduating, I moved to Buffalo, NY another city with too many Tim Hortons only now with extra fatal blizzards.</p>

    <!-- Applies sentence class to the first sentence of my last paragraph via encasement in span.-->
<p> <span class="sentence">Living in Buffalo is when I truly came into my own as an individual. </span> I discovered new hobbies like making music boxes, digital art, motorcycles, and music. Additionally, I made even more friends, many of which I'm still very close with. Buffalo is still where I find myself,
    however, as time moves on I find myself itching to relocate, but to where I have no idea. Find out in chapter 2 of this riveting tale. </p>
